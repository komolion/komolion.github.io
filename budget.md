For 2019, our major fundraising goals will be $40,000, which includes the following:

- **Girls’ education for 2019 - $17,730**: [Supporting the education of girls in Komolion](/projects/girls-education.html)
is an ongoing effort. This amount covers tuition, uniforms, textbooks, education-related trips, and necessary toiletries
for the 16 girls we support.

- **House for two village teachers – $4,515**: Education in the village school is poor because most teachers do not live
there and cannot always meet their classes. A small home for two teachers with bathroom and kitchen will guarantee their
presence in the village.

- **Pendo Amani Rent for 2019 – $4,124**: Rent for [Mike Wachira’s youth ministry](/projects/pendo-amani.html).

- **Pendo Amani Projects – $2,356**: Mike Wachira’s program includes tutoring, leadership development and musical
training for youth in the Nairobi area.

- **Coming-of-age ceremony (Dec 2019) – $5,000**: This amount includes materials (certificates, shirts) for the girls
that go through this important ceremony as well as food, water, accommodations, and travel for all involved. For more
context on this ceremony, read about our efforts in [Combating Female Genital Mutilation](/projects/combating-fgm.html).

- **Boys’ education for 2019 – $6,250**: In order to build leadership in Komolion, we need educated men. We would like
to put 5 boys in boarding school in 2019.

**Total needed: $39,975**
