Pendo Amani (“love peace” in Swahili) is a youth development center located in Juja, about nineteen miles north of
Nairobi, Kenya. The director, Mike Wachira, is a long-time friend of  the Komolion HDF founders and a talented artist.
Here is his description of Pendo Amani.

##### Goal 
Our programs provide a platform to develop leadership skills and experiences for young people and enhance their civic
role.

##### Approach
The leadership building program consists of different topics that enhance leadership skills and personal growth to
support youth in their growth and continued development. Topics are delivered through seminars, trainings and events.
We organize a year-round youth football league, music and dance sessions, and training in computer and media skills.
We operate a learning center to help youth improve their academic performance. There is a Saturday book club in which
students ages 11-14 read stories to each other. All the activities are conducted in a gender sensitive way in a
volunteer-based setting and they combine both informal education and value based learning.

##### Impact
The program has had more than 945 participants annually. One student scored 417 out of a potential 500 points on the
last national examination and has been awarded a full scholarship by one of the banks.  Another 25 students scored at
the 300 level. All the activities are conducted in a gender sensitive way in a volunteer based setting and they combine
both informal education and value based learning. We are continuously mobilizing young people and making our activities
more accessible to ensure that more young people can benefit and experience the love of Christ.
