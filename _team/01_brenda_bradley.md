Brenda Bradley serves as the vice president and a member of the board of directors for Komolion Human Development Fund.
Brenda has participated in mission work internationally and locally since first serving on a mission team to Torreon,
Mexico in 1984, and she has helped lead student and volunteer groups with Randall, her husband, since then. Brenda is a
professor of English at McLennan Community College and has been an educator since 1982. She believes her lifeâ€™s calling
has been to motivate and inspire students to find purpose and fulfillment through the tool of education, particularly
those from unconventional and underserved backgrounds. Frequently finding ways to connect her community college students
to learning projects internationally, she has been a guest teacher in places from Kazakhstan to Kenya. The experiences
and people she has encountered in her travels have also inspired much of her poetry.
