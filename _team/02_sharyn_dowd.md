Sharyn Dowd serves as the secretary and a member of the board of
directors for Komolion Human Development Fund. Sharyn has been involved
in various kinds of mission work since her college days at Wake Forest
University. Her interests have focused on people who, with additional
resources and encouragement, can move from subsistence living to
abundant lives in Christian community. Since 2007, Sharyn has been
active with the work of Randall and Brenda Bradley in Kenya. She is
especially concerned to reduce female genital mutilation and early
marriage in the Pokot village of Komolion by funding boarding school
scholarships and a village-planned alternative rite of passage for
girls. A retired Baptist minister, Sharyn has served churches, led
short-term missions, and taught university and seminary students in
Georgia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Texas, the District of Columbia,
Mississippi, and Mexico.
